                Looking at a visualization that encapsulates so much flow data at once can be daunting.<br />
                Let's examine the data first by where there is communication, then by how much<br>communication is happening measured by number of packets.
                <br> <br> <br>
		<h3>OVERVIEW</h3><br>
                Here each blue line represents a flow between modules. 
                <br>Opacity is being used to represent number of flows.

	      <h3>RECEIVE</h3><br>
              Black circles indicate modules that did not receive any packets. 
                <br>Size of red ones correspond to relative number of packets received (using log scale).
                <br>Click on a circle to see the modules that sent packets to the selected module.
