                                今天是我最后一天在EA当实习生。 我在EA过得很好，有点舍不得走。我最后一天的时间发在完成我的实习项目。虽然我还有很多
                                还想进步的地方，我对我现在的写好的软件感觉很满意。没想到我能在很多人的面前演示我做的软件。
                                <br><br>
                                我在EA见了许多很酷的人，包括我公司里的班组和其他实习生。真的很幸福能遇到那么和善的人–-我已经知道走了以后，我会想念他们。
                                特别是我交的实习生朋友。如果你们两在读这个。。。也没事；甚至你们找到我的博客，你们也肯定不会读中文。我希望我们能以后再见。

                                It's the last day of my internship at EA. I really had a great time here and I'm a bit sad to say
                                that it's over. I was able to quickly wrap up my project and document everything as well as I could
                                in the time remaining. There are many things I wish I could continue working on if I had the time,
                                but there's nothing I regret in terms of how I used my time in the last two weeks. I got to demo
                                my project several times to lots of people (more than I thought), and I actually got the opportunity
                                to practice many times in preparation.
                                <br><br>
                                I met lots of cool people at EA, including my team and the other interns. I feel really lucky to have
                                gotten such a friendly and welcoming team at EA. I've never seen a team with such good chemistry
                                as the one I was placed with (where they would actually even hang out outside the company :O ).
                                I'm going to miss a lot of my intern friends as well (see two of them in the above picture).
                                LOL I'd actually be quite embarrassed if either of them see this website. But if they are reading this,
                                definitely know that I think you two are really awesome people and it was great hanging out together
                                (especially *darts* and *the bus*). There are also a lot of other interns who I'm really glad to have met,
                                and I sincerely hope at some point in the future we would meet again!

                                SF Bay Area has been really nice. It's uncertain when I would come back but I think if I stick with
                                tech (most likely), I'll surely be back. Well that's it for this summer blog--which I've only updated
                                four times haha, but good enough! Thanks for reading.

                                Destination: Pacifica State Beach <br>
                                Mission: See some dogs perform something extraodinary <br><br>
                                I've known about the existence of dog surfing for a while, but I've never known how real it is
                                until now. Well, it's kind of actually real. These dogs do indeed go on surfboards with life jackets
                                on and they do ride a small wave into the sand (though, more often than not, crash into the water). <br>
                                I was really lucky to have a friend who drove us along the west coast of the Bay Area to see some
                                beaches and check out this event. There were so, so many dogs and so much happiness in the air.
                                If I could just bottle some of it up and bring it with me back to UChicago, where it definitely gets
                                eerie and gloomy at times, it would be so very valuable. I'm glad I got the chance to witness dog
                                surfing in person. <br><br>
                                Later that evening, I attended a networking event at the California Academy of Sciences for D.E. Shaw & Co.
                                They actually rented out the place for the evening, with museum staff to display exhibits in the
                                rainforest and aquarium part of the museum. It was refreshing to get this new kind of exposure to
                                a company with an educational component, but I'm not too sure what the point of bringing in the

                                We got to chat casually with current employees there and I have a few take-aways from the event:
                                D.E. Shaw likes to recruit kind people who like to learn and are very good at \something\.
                                While not all, many of the employees have a PhD in \something\, and the idea is whatever skills
                                helped them become very good at the \something\ can be transferable to the work they will be
                                doing at the company. Seems like they treat their employees very well, but I can't
                                say for sure if they are my ideal kind of company yet. <br><br>
                                It was kind of tricky getting home to Atherton from a place so far away, but I managed to combine
                                walking + light rail + uber, to get home safe and sound.

                                I arrive at the Japanese Zen Garden in the Golden Gate Park. Despite overflowing tourists
                                covering each corner of the garden, I find myself in a very peaceful state of zen--perfect
                                for some de-stressing meditation! So calming that I actually in fact take a brief
                                energizing nap with my friend on look out!

                                Did ya notice it's a Wednesday? Maybe you're wondering how I got out of work :^)
                                I would like to preface that I love work very much so I worked extra on the other weekdays so that
                                I could take a day off to show my elementary school friend, who is visiting me here,
                                all the touristy hot spots.

                                We began the day pretty early to catch a Caltrain up to San Francisco (4th and King). I brought my
                                [brother's] camera to complete our appearance as tourists and to snap some picturesque shots of SF.
                                Yelp suggested that we stop by at <a href="http://tacorea.com/">Tacorea</a> to grab some fusion Korean and
                                Mexican food--which we did--and it was delicious. I will say that one burrito is very filling and if
                                you're cautious of falling into a midday food coma, maybe just share one with a friend for a meal?
                                I definitely recommend getting their California burrito. <br><br>
                                We ended up taking the light rail and going all the way to the Golden Gate park and explored the rose
                                garden and of course, the Japanese Zen Garden. We actually took a detour after the rose garden; after
                                spotting some wild mushrooms and discovering the scenic woods hidden below the rose garden, we slid
                                down the hill to get to the woods. It was there where we took the nice picture above :)

                                It's my first time in California. I'm over at Silicon Valley for a summer internship and the
                                weather is ridiculously perfect every day.
