                I was born in New York City and lived in the Lower East Side. I speak English ((fluent)) and Mandarin ((coherent)),
                and studied Spanish ((vaguely unintelligible)) for four years. I graduated from Stuyvesant High School with lots of knowledge on Mozart's and Gaugin's personal life, as well as technical drawing! I'm now studying computer science and the art of time managementâ„¢ at the University of Chicago.
                <br><br>
                I like to cook food that's a little too spicy, read novels about resilient characters, and be a part of projects that do social good. 
                <br>
                I'm currently leading the technical side of a project to combat the air pollution in India with peers from my school.

                <br>
                I'm also leading a project for the Chicago Department of Health on improving the reporting system of critical and contagious diseases for public safety with five other developers. I'm excited to share the completion
                of the project coming mid-June.
