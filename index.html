                I was born in New York City then spent my childhood in rural China before returning to the US and living in the Lower East Side. I speak English (fluent) and Mandarin (还可以),
                and studied Spanish for four years (pero no sé nada). I graduated from Stuyvesant High School with lots of knowledge on Mozart's and Gaugin's personal life, as well as technical drawing! I'm now studying computer science and the art of time management™ at the University of Chicago.
                <br><br>
                I like to cook food that's a little too spicy, read novels about resilient characters, and be a part of projects that do social good.

                I led the technical side of a start up to combat the air pollution in India with peers from my school.

                Here's an article about us from the school newspaper</a>.
                I'm also leading a project for the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) on improving the reporting system of critical and contagious diseases for public safety with five other developers. It's currently in the process of alpha testing at the CDPH.
